# Group-Messenger-1

This is the initial phase of group messenger in "Android". It just has the basic functionality of sending 
the messages to different AVDs and store the messages in the persistent storage. 
For this project I have used simple "Files" for persistent storage where key is the file name and value is the data 
written inside the file.
Content Provider of Android is used to store and access structured set of data.
